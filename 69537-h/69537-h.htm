<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE proclamation of a “Holy War”
by the Sheikh-ul-Islam at Constantinople
has excited interest above and
beyond its connection with the present
war. It has raised the whole question
of the validity and effectiveness of this
measure as a political instrument in the
hands of a modern Mohammedan government.
Students of Islam have asked
themselves of what use this weapon, taken
from the arsenal of a theocratic form of
sovereignty, could be in a state which is
in process of conforming to the present-day
theory of secular and democratic
control. The development of the Ottoman
Empire since the granting of the Constitution
in 1908 has been followed with an
interested eye by those of us who have felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
the immense possibilities inherent in the
Turkish people and latent in Turkish soil.
It is with distinct pleasure that we read
the following study of a knotty problem;
for it is worked out with the hand of a
master. There are few so well equipped
or so competent to effect such a study—especially
in the relations of the question
to the larger problems of the day—as is
Dr. C. Snouck Hurgronje. One of the rare
Europeans who have ever travelled in that
part of Arabia considered by Mohammedans
to be sacred and exclusive, his stay
of eight months in the capital of their
faith (1884-1885) enabled him not only
to write the most complete and the most
reliable history of that city (<i>Mekka</i>,
Leiden, 1888), but also to talk with the
faithful from all the corners of the
Mohammedan world. As Councillor to
the Government of Netherlands-India, he
spent the years 1889-1906 in Batavia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[v]</span>
where he came into closest touch with the
development of Islam in the farthest East.
He has laid down many of his conclusions
in his comprehensive work on the
Achehnese (<i>De Atjehers</i>, Leiden, 1903-1904;
English translation, London, 1906).
His scholarly lectures on the origins of
Islam, given before various American
university audiences in the spring of 1914,
will long be remembered for the cool
judgment and the careful poise they
evinced. In the periodical publications
of learned societies he has contributed
numerous essays which easily place him
in the very forefront of authorities on
the subject which he has made his own.</p>

<p>The study which is here presented to the
English-reading public appeared originally
in the Dutch periodical <i>De Gids</i>, 1915,
No. 1, under the title “Heilige Oorlog
Made in Germany.” It has been ably
translated by Professor Joseph E. Gillet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
of the University of Wisconsin, with the
distinct attempt to preserve as much of
the style of the author as the English language
will permit. I am glad of the
opportunity to express publicly my thanks
to Professor Gillet for the readiness with
which he accepted the task I laid upon him.</p>

“Made in Germany”</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MORE than ten years ago I had a conversation
with a Turk of a highly
intellectual type about religious fanaticism
and its bearing on political situations.
He concluded his considerations
on this subject about as follows: “In
former times the inhabitants of the civilized
world used to destroy each other for
being at variance about the mysteries of
the other world. Now, however, glory
be to Allah, humanity has overcome this
barbarous custom and everybody is free
to believe what he likes. But what good
is this to us, as long as wars continue to
be waged on account of economic and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
political interests, wars of which the
fanaticism is not to be outdone by that
of the bitterest religious strife, and of
which the destructiveness is continuously
being increased by our immense technical
progress? Under such circumstances a
quiet enjoyment of the hard-won freedom
of thought is out of the question.”</p>

<p>This utterance ever again obtrudes itself
on my memory in connexion with the
events that are taking place at present.
Large groups of men, kept apart by varying
political and economic interests, have
for years and years consumed an important
part of their intellectual and material
resources in devising means by which, in
the fulness of time, they might destroy
each other; and now, at last, the long-expected
spark has fallen on the accumulated
fuel. Every one of the belligerents
is horrified by the idea of responsibility
for the crimes against mankind which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
they are perpetrating in common. The
culture they shared with each other has
been shelved and finds its only expression
in a dull series of contentions where each
one charges the other with the guilt of
what they have all carefully planned
together. The sceptical irony of my
Turkish friend was not unjustified. Not
that it teaches us anything new. Only in
this respect might his utterance be somewhat
surprising to those of us who are
not familiar with the Mohammedan world,
that it shows a Turk recognizing without
restriction general religious peace and
freedom of thought as an undisputed
possession. Considered from this point
of view the words quoted here are the
more valuable, as they express with
tolerable accuracy the opinion of all
Turkish intellectuals on the problem of
religion.</p>

<p>This tolerance seems irreconcilable with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the prescriptions of the Mohammedan
law concerning the attitude towards the
adherents of other religions. For, according
to this law, which as a whole
claims divine authority, the whole world
of man is to be subjected to the Mohammedan
community and is also, as far as
possible, to be incorporated by it in a
spiritual sense. That this aim may be
attained, the community of the faithful
is to do <i>jihâd</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, carry on a <i>holy war</i>
against all that are still living outside
the circle of its authority. The leadership
in the <i>jihâd</i>, the determination of
time, place, and means, is one of the chief
duties of the head of the community, the
Caliph, the successor of Mohammed as
supreme governor, supreme judge, and
supreme commander of all the Moslims.
As the interests of Islâm in his opinion
require it, he is to carry on this war with
more or less energy or even temporarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
to desist from it. Under no circumstances
may he agree to a suspension of
the offensive against a nation of unbelievers
for more than ten years. Provided
they subject themselves to the Mohammedan
state-authority and are satisfied
with the position of subjects without civic
rights, adherents of the Jewish and of the
Christian religion, and of such religions
as obtain equal recognition with those,
are granted the exercise of their religion,
though with certain restrictions. In the
case of real heathens subjection must be
accompanied by conversion.</p>

<p>The <i>jihâd</i>-program assumes that the
Mohammedans, just as at their first appearance
in the world, continuously form
a compact unity under one man’s leadership.
But this situation has in reality
endured so short a time, the realm of
Islâm has so quickly disintegrated into
an increasingly large number of principalities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the supreme power of the so-called
Caliph, after flourishing for a short
period, has become so much a mere word,
that even the <i>jihâd</i>-prescriptions have had
to be adapted to this state of crumbling
authority. As in most other respects so
also concerning the waging of the holy
war, the law therefore transfers the authority
and the duties of the one Caliph to
the various territorial heads, to each one
for the extent of his dominion. Now it
is evident that this shifting of authority
from one to many is a great simplifying
influence for the internal government;
but it is equally evident that by this disintegration
the continuance of the world-conquest,
as it was started in the first
century of Islâm, is made impossible.</p>

<p>To be sure, there were a number of other
causes which stemmed the first wild rush
of the Moslim legions. They met frontiers
where resistance could not be broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
at once, and the enjoyment of what had
been conquered weakened their energy.
The great deeds of the first generations
were idealized in the imagination of the
later ones, the stains removed from them,
and the theory of their desirable continuance
elaborated in details, the more
casuistical as their realization was getting
further outside the sphere of possibilities.
Only where a Mohammedan territory is
attacked by a nation of unbelievers, there
the duty of defence is put upon the whole
of the population. Offensive action is
justified only when it is ordered and regulated
by a recognized head of the state.
Where unbelievers succeed in subjecting
a Moslim population, the latter must not
resign itself to this state of submission,
but must grasp the first opportunity for
either throwing off the yoke or for emigrating
to an independent Moslim country;
and this as much in order to ward off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the danger with which their own religion
is threatened, as in order to strengthen
the ranks of the faithful for the struggle
against the enemy, <i>i. e.</i>, the non-subjected
unbelievers. Even if the impossibility of
effective resistance or emigration should
endure for centuries, the relation of
dependency upon a non-Mohammedan
state-authority created thereby is to be
accepted only as temporary and abnormal.</p>

<p>The whole set of laws which, according
to Islâm, should regulate the relations
between believers and unbelievers, is the
most consequent elaboration imaginable
of a mixture of religion and of politics in
their mediæval form. That he who possesses
material power should also dominate
the mind is accepted as a matter of
course; the possibility that adherents of
different religions could live together as
citizens of the same state and with equal
rights is excluded. Such was the situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
in the Middle Ages not only with
the Mohammedans: before and even long
after the Reformation our ancestors did
not think very differently on the matter.
The difference is chiefly this, that Islâm
has fixed all these mediæval regulations
in the form of eternal laws, so that later
generations, even if their views have
changed, find it hard to emancipate themselves
from them. This emancipation
became all the more difficult because both
the multitude and the scribes clung the
more tightly to this questionable legacy
of their ancestors, the more circumstances
seemed to flout the realization of
this mighty program. It is a fact that
in the countries of Islâm all through the
centuries little care has been given to the
education of the masses, and the idea of
a future world-domination was too pleasing
to their vanity to be lightly discarded.
The jurists, in their narrowness, did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
partake of the fulness of real life; they
anxiously preserved the forms of the
ancient ideals without noticing that their
contents had vanished. To them the
appreciation of religious freedom by intellectual
Turks, such as the friend quoted
above, was and still is a frivolous concession
to the debased spirit of the times.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the minds went on their
forward march, in the past century often
with surprising rapidity. Through the
very harshness of Mohammedan society
and the inefficiency and corruption of
the Mohammedan governments the whole
territory of Islâm, in contrast to its
conscious program of world-dominion,
gradually came under European influence.
This has gone so far already that more
than ninety per cent. of all Mohammedans
live in conquered territory or in protectorates
under the political rule of European
powers, whereas the independence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
remaining part, chiefly Turkey, is maintained
in appearance only by a certain
cleverness in balancing between the large
powers which are vying for its tutelage.</p>

<p>This coming into contact of the territory
of Islâm and the world outside
which has ended with the total loss of
the former’s political independence, was
originally brought about by the necessity
of Europe to expand economically, that
is, by the self-interest of the nations
which were able to shake off the dust of
the Middle Ages and which overtook the
Mohammedans in a spiritual as well as in
a material sense. Later on only did the
narrow idea of exploitation give way to
that of annexation and eventually to that
of complete absorption of the conquered
territories, in the sense that the population
was to be educated into partaking,
as far as they could and was deemed expedient,
of the culture of the conquerors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
This was not done at one stroke; the
struggle between the egotism of the guardians
and their sense of duty to their
wards is still in full swing. But the
European guardians, even those for whom
the consequent application of the newer
principles is often too hard a task, would
even now be ashamed to profess any other
principle of government but that of a
pure harmony between the interests of
two nations, of which one has been subordinated
by history to the other. The
Mohammedans under direct or indirect
European government have already derived
considerable benefit from this; and
one may say that on the whole they are
better off than their co-religionists in
the quasi-independent states, where they
suffer the disadvantages both of a corrupt
administration and of the struggle for
economic gain between the great powers
of the West. Still, the oppression under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
which the population labours in such a
country as Turkey has also excited aspirations
to intellectual development. The
Young-Turk movement of these late
years loudly speaks for that.</p>

<p>In the more highly developed circles
of all Mohammedan countries the conviction
has become general that the
mediæval mixture of religion and politics,
which the system of Islâm wanted to
uphold for ever, is not of our times. The
Mohammedans have become inferiors in
this world, politically and socially; so
much so that the idea of a world-dominion
founded on their religion could not keep
anything of its attraction for all but the
ignorant. The others are almost ashamed
of the presumption expressed by the
teaching of the <i>jihâd</i>, and try hard to
prove that the law itself restricts its
application to circumstances which do
not occur any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>The lesson of tolerance was least easily
impressed on the nations which had stood
in the front rank in the political heyday
of Islâm, least of all on the Turks who
had played the leading part in the last
scene of glory. When in 1258 Bagdad
was destroyed by the Mongols and the
Abasside Caliphate, dating more than
five centuries back, was wiped out, the
Mohammedan world was not lifted from
its hinges, as would have happened if the
Caliphate still had had anything to do
with the central government of the Mohammedans.
In fact, this princely house
had already been living three centuries
and a half on the faint afterglow of its
ephemeral splendour; and if during that
time it was not crowded out by one of the
many powerful sultans, its very practical
insignificance was the main reason
for that. So insignificant had these
caliphs in name become that certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
European writers sometimes have felt
induced to represent them as a kind of
religious princes of Islâm, who voluntarily
or not had transferred their secular
power to the many territorial princes in
the wide dominion of Islâm. To them
the total lack of secular authority,
coupled with the often-manifested reverence
of the Moslim for the Caliphate,
appeared unintelligible except on the
assumption of a spiritual authority, a
sort of Mohammedan papacy. Still, such
a thing there never was, and Islâm, which
knows neither priests nor sacraments,
could not have had occasion for it. Here,
as elsewhere, the multitude preferred
legend to fact: they imagined the successor
of the Prophet as still watching
over the whole of the Moslim community;
as, according to historical tradition, he
really did during the first two centuries
following the Hijrah, and this long after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the institution of the Caliphate had disappeared
in the political degeneration of
Islâm. However, they did not imagine
him as a pope, but as a supreme ruler;
above all as the <i>amîr-al-mu’-minîn</i>, commander
of the legions of Islâm, which
sometime would make the whole world
bend to its power.</p>

<p>The Caliph, the lieutenant of Allah’s
Messenger, and the <i>jihâd</i>, the holy war
against the whole world outside Islâm:
with those two names was indissolubly
connected the remembrance of those two
brilliant centuries in which the course of
circumstances seemed to justify the Mohammedan
ambition for world-dominion.
Whatever disappeared in reality survived
in legend; the worship of the shadow-Caliphs
of Bagdad made it easier for
many Mohammedans to forget the failure
of their political ideal.</p>

<p>When Bagdad had fallen and a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
part of the Abasside family had been
exterminated, this political fetishism still
had its after-effects; the sultans of Egypt
availed themselves of it by making one
of those who had escaped murder continue
the tradition of the dummy-Caliphate in
their capital and thus creating the impression
that their territory had now become
the centre of Islâm. But this shadow of
a shadow was to fade away entirely when
the sun of the Ottomans reached its
zenith. Under their direction Islâm ventured
its last attempt, not to subdue the
world, to be sure, but at least to become a
world-power of the first rank. They succeeded
in taking Constantinople (1452),
a task at which the greatest Moslim
princes of yore had vainly tried their
strength. When in 1517 they had conquered
Egypt and subsequently also the
province of the holy cities of Arabia,
Mecca and Medina, they felt themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
strong enough to try resuscitating the
tradition of the real Caliphate; or, at
least, to assume the part of fetish themselves.
They were not deterred from
this even by the express prescription of
the law, which requires that he who shall
occupy the Caliphate shall be descended
from the noble Arabian house of Qoraish.
The sophistry of complaisant jurists
helped them to remove this objection,
and the multitude did not resist these
tricks, seeing that the dreams which
they connected with the Caliphate now
seemed to turn into realities. The conqueror
of Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt,
Western Arabia, Mesopotamia, and the
empire of Byzantium, whom a large part
of Europe considered as a formidable foe,
might confidently substitute his sword
as a fetish for the powerless pedigree of
the Abassides.</p>

<p>This re-born Caliphate consequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
lacked important traditional characteristics;
and in other respects also it could
not be considered as the regular continuation
of its predecessor. Several of the
oldest Mohammedan countries remained
entirely outside the Turkish sphere of
influence; and those were not only such
where, as in Persia, a dynasty opposed
to the Turks raised the banner of heresy,
but also perfectly orthodox countries in
Central Asia, in India, in North-Western
Africa, where the Turkish sword found
no occasion to assert itself. In Morocco
the Turkish Caliphate was even directly
ignored, as the local princes, descendants
of the Prophet, themselves assumed the
highest title. Elsewhere, simultaneously
with the rise of the Ottomans or
after, there arose new Mohammedan
dominions which have never come into
contact with any real or supposed political
centre of Islâm; such as those in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the Far East of Asia and in Central
Africa.</p>

<p>Indeed the usurpation of the Caliph-title
by the Ottoman Sultans had only this
significance, that in their political period
of splendour they wished to have it established
beyond dispute that no other
Moslim prince could compare with them
in importance. This could in no wise be
more aptly done than by adding to all
their high-sounding Persian and Turkish
titles the name of the most exalted office
which had ever existed in Islâm. To
their power this nominal title of Caliph
has never added anything; they ruled
only what their armies had conquered
and outside those limits they did not
exert the slightest influence.</p>

<p>The Turkish sword soon lost its edge;
long before the policy of the great European
powers gnawed off piece after piece
from the realm of the Ottomans, several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
provinces had developed into separate
feudal dominions under hereditary dynasties.
Since Turkey, entirely dependent
in its policy upon non-Mohammedan
powers, can only claim about five per
cent. of the Mohammedans of the world
as its subjects, it would sound highly
ridiculous to have the Sultan of that
realm called “Lieutenant of God’s Messenger,
Supreme Commander of the Faithful,”
if also outside Turkey one were not
used to much traditional nonsense in
princely titles.</p>

<p>It is just in this last century that the
Turks, through a concourse of circumstances,
have sometimes succeeded in
coining some small advantage out of
this doubtfully legal, now meaningless
title.</p>

<p>Means of communication increased a
thousandfold have now brought into
contact Mohammedan nations which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
formerly knew nothing, or hardly anything,
about each other’s existence. The
approximately 230,000,000 of Mohammedans
living under non-Moslim rule
mostly do not possess sufficient historical
remembrance to understand that the
change in administration has been an
improvement for them. They see the
political past of Islâm only through the
veil of legend, and when the present gives
occasion for grievances and objections—and
where are these lacking?—they are
rather prone to believe that all their
complaints would be cured, if only the
Commander of the Faithful could take
their interests in hand. Of the maladministration
under which the real subjects
of the Sultan of Turkey are labouring,
they hear little and experience nothing.
And the Sultan, who has been the worst
in this respect, until in 1909 he was deposed
and exiled by his subjects, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
worked more zealously and more successfully
than any of his predecessors for the
dissemination amongst the Mohammedans
of the false imaginations concerning
the Caliphate. His wily but short-sighted
policy, which brought his own empire
ever nearer to its fall, made him seek
solace for many a failure in Panislamic
intrigues, staged by unscrupulous but
mostly ignorant and blundering confederates,
who showed the credulous the
ideal picture of a Caliph, assuring them
that it was a good likeness of Abdulhamîd.</p>

<p>There has often been talk of an organization
of Panislâm under the direction of
Abdulhamîd, but this is without foundation.
In 1897, in connexion with some
foul, secretly circulated, pamphlets, which
the most intimate counsellors of the Sultan
in vying for his favour had let loose
against each other, I tried to describe the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
atmosphere around the despot,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and when,
in 1908, I witnessed the first two months of
the revolution in Constantinople, I found
a complete justification of my description.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
That gang of shallow intriguers
was little qualified to lead a serious international
movement. They exploited
the connexions established with certain
Mohammedans of consequence in non-Turkish
territory to increase their own
advantage and prestige, without being
of any real use in the resuscitation
of the dead Caliphate. The establishment
of a few Turkish consulates in
Mohammedan countries under European
rule also failed of its aim. They usually
forgot to pay the consuls their salaries;
the consuls did not even know the languages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
of the populations amongst whom
they lived, and took no pains to learn
them. Their mostly very “advanced”
manner of living did not serve to heighten
respect for the man who sent them.</p>

<p>It is a fact that Panislâm cannot work
with any program except with the worn-out,
flagrantly impracticable, program
of world-conquest by Islâm; and this
has lost its hold on all sensible adherents
of Islâm; whereas, among the stupid
multitude, which may still be tempted by
the idea of war against all <i>kâfirs</i>, it can
stir up only confusion and unrest. At
most it may cause local disturbances; but
it can never in any sense have a constructive
influence.</p>

<p>Probably without intention, some European
statesmen and writers have given a
certain support to the Panislamic idea
by their consideration, based on an absolute
misunderstanding, of the Caliphate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
as a kind of Mohammedan papacy. Most
of all did this conception find adherents
in England at the time when that country
was still considered to be the protector
of the Turk against danger threatened
by Russia. It was thought useful to
make the British-Indian Moslim believe
that the British Government was on
terms of intimate friendship with the
head of their church. Turkish statesmen
made clever use of this error. Of course
they could not admit before their European
friends the real theory of the Caliphate
with its mission of uniting all the
faithful under its banner in order to make
war on all <i>kâfirs</i>. They rejoiced all the
more to see that these had formed about
that institution a conception which, to
be sure, was false, but for that very reason
plausible to non-Mohammedans. They
took good care not to correct it, for they
were satisfied with being able, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
their co-religionists, to point to the fact
that even among the great non-Mohammedan
powers the claim of the Ottomans
to the Caliphate was recognized.</p>

<p>Although Panislâm was not organized,
nevertheless in Mohammedan countries
under European rule it often would oppose
the normal development of a mutually
desirable relation between the governing
and the governed. Speculating on dissatisfaction
in every form, it secretly
worked as a disturbing element, without
there being any hope that the division
caused or intensified might lead to improvements.</p>

<p>All European powers must have hailed
as a welcome consequence of the revolution
of 1908 the fact that the Young Turks
who forced the re-establishment of the
constitution wanted to put an end to the
mediæval mixture of religion and politics.
The upholding of Islâm as a state-religion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
was on their part a concession to the old
tradition, without prejudice to the complete
equality of the adherents of all religions
as citizens of the Turkish Empire.
Re-born Turkey was to be a modern
constitutional state in the full meaning of
the word. For Caliphate and <i>jihâd</i> there
was no room in such a state. Turks and
Arabs, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews, and
whoever else lived together under the
Crescent, were to co-operate in liberty,
equality, and fraternity to make Young
Turkey into a state respected in international
life. The empire of the Ottomans
was not to presume on any interference
with co-religionists living under non-Mohammedan
rule. At most the government,
in case such had reason to complain
about the violation of their rights, might
permit representations to be made similar
to those which the Christian powers had
so often addressed to Turkey in connexion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
with alleged oppression of Christian
nations under Turkish rule.</p>

<p>Soon these ideals were shown to be too
exalted for the time being. The greed
of the European powers did not grant
Young Turkey the rest necessary for
internal reform. Upon the enthusiastic
harmony of the first days of deliverance
from the claws of despotism, there speedily
followed the renascence of the old
internal strife, now no longer held in
leash by the common fear of the despot.
The Committee of Unity and Progress,
which before or behind the scenes had
the direction of things, found itself constrained
on one side to resort again to
the hateful governing methods of despotism,
on the other side to grant many
concessions to the detriment of its own
program, even to Moslim orthodoxy and
to the beliefs and superstitions of the
multitude. The fetish of the Caliphate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
had to be exhumed again from the museum
of antiquities where it had temporarily
been stored. As to the idea of
<i>jihâd</i>, which was so closely connected
with it, the European powers took care
that it was not forgotten. Turkey was
continually forced to a <i>jihâd</i>.</p>

<p>When we translate the word <i>jihâd</i> by
“holy war” this is justified, inasmuch as
such a war has for the Mohammedans a
holy, a religious character. But it is a
mistake to imagine that besides this there
exists a non-holy or secular war. Apart
from using the army to repress revolt
against lawful authority, which must
be considered as a police measure, Islâm
knows no war other than the <i>jihâd</i>, and
no other aim to the <i>jihâd</i> than the defence
of the interests of Islâm against attacks
by non-Mohammedans or the extension
of the territory of Islâm to the detriment
of the Dâr al-Harb, the country of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
unbelievers. The wars which Turkey
had to carry on under Abdulhamîd
against Russia and against Greece have
never been called by Turks and Arabs
by any other name but <i>jihâd</i>, even if they
were prudent enough not to use that term
of mediæval fanaticism in their intercourse
with Europeans. This holds true
also of the war with Italy for the
possession of Tripoli and of that with
the Balkan States. For the Mohammedans,
who continue in the old fashion
mixing politics and religion, there is no
other war but religious war. That a
special edict of the Sultan-Caliph should
be needed to stamp one of Turkey’s wars
as a holy war, is one more of those ridiculous
misconceptions of things Mohammedan,
of which so many have become
current in Europe. The Turks do not
usually protest against such nonsense;
but in their dealings with Europeans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
they mostly endorse it when their interest
requires it. For no Moslim in the world,
however, when Turkey is involved in war,
does the question whether the Sultan has
decreed the holy war possess a reasonable
meaning. All this ought to be well considered
if one is to understand correctly
the political events of these days in so far
as they involve Turkey.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>About these events pamphlets have
been published in Germany, which in
certain respects perhaps deserve some
attention even outside that country.
<i>Deutschland, die Türkei und der Islam</i> is
the title of a pamphlet by Hugo Grothe,
who is considered as qualified in the field
of economics, and whose former writings
contain the results of his scientific journeys
in European and Asiatic Turkey,
in Persia and in Tripolitania. This pamphlet
is part of a series, <i>Zwischen Krieg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
und Frieden</i>, edited by Irmer, Lamprecht,
and von Liszt, containing political articles
for the public at large. Amongst its contributors
appears Prince von Bülow.</p>

<p>When Grothe departs from economic
politics he at once shows himself to be in
unfamiliar surroundings. The political
problem of Islâm, <i>e. g.</i>, is not clear in his
mind. The Caliphate he calls the secular
representation of the religious community
of the Mohammedans, a rather vague
expression of the idea that all Mohammedans
in a political sense are legally
subjects of the Caliph; who to be sure is
kept from exercising his administrative
rights over what now amounts to ninety-five
per cent. of these subjects by unbelieving
princes whose authority is necessarily
illegal. But now Grothe on another page
quotes the following from a proclamation
issued by the Imperial Governor of
Kamerun to the native population: “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
are further given help by the Sultan
in Stambul, who in matters of religion
is the Supreme Lord of all Mohammedans,”
and far from adding the necessary
correction, he calls this official nonsense
“interesting.” Grothe’s assertion that at
the outset of the present war the “<i>jihâd</i>
of Germany” had been the subject of
debates and prayers in the mosques of
Turkey is perhaps a poetical phrase, for,
even if we translate <i>jihâd</i> about correctly
as “holy war,” still our “holy war,” as
now every belligerent calls his own struggle,
is by no means rendered by the
Arabic-Mohammedan <i>jihâd</i>. When old-fashioned
pious Mohammedans refer to
this war in their prayer, the prayer will
sound about as follows: “We thank Thee,
Allah, for having divided the legions of
the Devil against themselves and because
Thy almightiness forces some of them
to support the defenders of Islâm with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
their arms and their men. Arrange all
this, O Lord, for a speedy victory of the
faithful and for the ruin of all who disobey
Thee and Thy Messenger.” Thus
and thus only is the conception of those
Moslims who have not yet been sufficiently
sobered by history to share the view
of the Turk whose words I quoted at the
beginning of this article.</p>

<p>It is also poetical phrasing of Grothe’s
when he makes an earthquake perceived
at Konia, Bundur, and Sparta contribute
towards giving the Turks real insight into
the meaning of the catastrophe which
has befallen us; poetical phrasing, when
in his travels he continually hears Turks,
Arabs, Kurds, and Anatolians professing
their sympathy for Germany and expressing
views on contemporary politics which
do not, either, differ one jot from Grothe’s
own. He hears them expressing those
in languages of which he understands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
nothing, for the two Turkish expressions
which Grothe uses are unidiomatic.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>We remain nearer to reality when we
follow Grothe’s survey of the politico-economic
relations between Turkey and
Germany, as they developed in the last
twenty years of the nineteenth century.
Germany, he says, through a concourse
of unfavourable circumstances, has been
badly outdistanced in the race of the
European powers for the economic and
commercial advantages which are to be
had in Turkish territory. In fact, a
change for the better started only with
the concession of the Anatolian railway
to a German syndicate (1888) which was
followed later on by that of the Bagdad
railway. One gets an idea of the rapidity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
of the movement by looking at the
figures of imports and exports combined,
between Germany and Turkey: 14 million
for 1888, but for 1913, 200-250 million
marks. The competition with England,
France, and Russia again made it desirable
for all parties that their spheres of
interest should be determined. Before
the war the understanding had come so
far that they were expected in the present
year to reach an agreement, by which
England would receive Southern Mesopotamia
as its economic territory, France
Syria, Germany the part of Mesopotamia
and Asia Minor which is bounded on
the one hand by the 34th and 41st
degrees of east longitude, and on the
other by the 36th and 39th degrees of
northern latitude, whereas the northern
part of Asia Minor was to be given
to a French-Russian combine for railway
construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>For this economic sphere of influence
Germany would have felt slightly grateful,
but by no means satisfied. Since
August she has started pegging out quite
different frontiers, on the assumption, of
course, that her expectations of a propitious
result of the war will not be disappointed.
For this, according to Grothe,
she has every right. For it must be
considered certain that in case Germany
were to fail, Russia would not hesitate
to destroy the Turkish Empire. As
Russia cannot find in the Far East the
ice-free waterway which she needs for
her development without getting into
conflict with Japan, and not in the Persian
Gulf without getting into conflict with
England, the Empire of the Czars is more
than ever determined to possess Constantinople.
England, who formerly has
always opposed this, would now support
it; in return, she would be allowed to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
upon Mesopotamia and Arabia as her
own.</p>

<p>Germany alone can save Turkey, and
she has a huge interest in doing so since
only the preservation of the complete
integrity of the Ottoman Empire will
make it possible for Germany to protect
and to develop the economic position
which she has gained in it. Besides,
Germany is the only one among the large
powers with which Turkey has to count
who would not wish to annex a single foot
of the country, and could not even if
she wanted to. Germany’s geographical
position would prevent her from effectively
protecting such possessions and
deriving profit from them. That is why
during the twenty-five years of her more
intimate relations with Turkey, Germany
has always been the only trustworthy
friend of the Empire of the Sultan-Caliph.
There is between the two countries, apart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
from all questions of sentiment, a natural
community of interests, whereas the interests
of all the other large powers can
only be furthered at the cost of Turkey’s
welfare, and finally of her existence.</p>

<p>Turkey has not always looked at it
quite in this light; a certain distrust had
to be overcome, fostered by the unfair
competition of those who envied Germany
and also partly strengthened by
Germany’s often too feeble policy. But
now the scales have fallen from the eyes
of the Young Turks, who hold the helm
of state. It seems that in Constantinople
they are only waiting for German
victories in Northern France and in
Galicia—Grothe wrote before the Turkish
declaration of war—before uniting with
Germany and Austria against the Allied
Powers. The Turkish army, which in
its organization owes so much already to
German teaching and direction, will have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
great need of German help and support
in order to accomplish its task, but then
it will also constitute a far from contemptible
ally. This will be especially true
if the Caliph decrees the <i>great holy war</i>,
the <i>jihâd</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Here now Grothe finds himself quite
at sea, as he does not know that for
Mohammedans of the old stamp, who
have not taken part in the intellectual
movement of the Mohammedan East
in the last few years, every war waged by
Turkey is a <i>jihâd</i>. For such as these the
question is not: “<i>jihâd</i> or secular war?”
but “against whom has Turkey declared
<i>jihâd</i>?” And then, supposing the answer
is as Grothe imagines, <i>i. e.</i>, <i>jihâd</i> “against
all powers that have devoured Mohammedan
countries and thus have robbed
Islâm of its splendour,” the question
remains whether, as Grothe hopes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
expects, the Mohammedan nations under
European rule will really be so charmed
by the call to arms issued in the name of
Sultan Mehmed Reshâd, that they will
attack their masters “<i>here with secrecy
and ruse, there with fanatical courage</i>.”
Grothe already sees in his imagination
how “<i>the thus developed religious war</i>”—so
he openly calls it—is to mean especially
for England “<i>the decline of her greatness</i>.”</p>

<p>We know that Turkey is at present
engaged in an experiment with just such
a holy war, as suggested by Grothe and
his intellectual kin. The highest juridical
authority in Constantinople, the
Sheich-ul-Islâm, who since the revolution
of 1908 has ever been a creature and
an instrument of the Young Turk Committee,
has answered affirmatively a
series of questions submitted to him by
the insignificant successor of Abdulhamîd,
with whom the leaders of the Young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Turk Committee can do as they please.
In reality those questions and answers
together form a proclamation of Enver
and Taläat, the leading ministers on the
Committee, and both he who asks the
questions (the Sultan) and he who answers
them (the Sheich-ul-Islâm) fill the office
of puppets. This proclamation of the
men on the Committee of Unity and
Progress (by which—let it be noted!—was
originally meant the union of the
several nations under the Crescent and
their progress as a modern state) is to
the effect, that, when the Lord of all
Mohammedans declares holy war against
the enemies of Islâm, who plunder the
countries of Islâm and slaughter their
inhabitants or reduce them into slavery,
it is the duty of all Mohammedans in
this world to take part in this war with
life and goods; that therefore especially
the Mohammedan subjects of France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Russia, and England are also obliged to
participate in it; that those who neglect
this duty and avoid the struggle incur
the anger of God; that, however, Mohammedans
who live under the rule of the
said powers or their allies and help them
wage war against Germany and Austria,
the supporters of Turkey, commit a
great sin that will certainly bring on the
wrath of God. This proclamation of the
prescriptions of the Divine Law as applied
to the political situation of the moment,
and according to the pronouncement of
its authoritative interpreter, served as
the basis of a manifesto of the Sultan
to the army and navy, issued on November
12, 1914.</p>

<p>This manifesto assumes that Russia,
together with England and France, has
started the hostilities; that Turkey therefore
was forced to take up arms; that
Russia anyway had not during three centuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
let one opportunity escape to harm
Turkey; that millions of Mohammedans
are suffering under the tyrannical rule
of the said powers; that therefore the
holy war has been declared, upon the
issue of which not only the welfare of
the Turkish Empire but also the life and
future of three hundred million<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of Mohammedans
depend. The mercy of Allah
and the support of the Prophet will turn
the struggle against the enemies of Islâm,
undertaken together with Germany and
Austria, into victory.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Constantinople would not be Constantinople
if these extravagant utterances of
the Committee<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> had not been followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
by a demonstration, a <i>numâyashi</i>. When
in 1908 I was witnessing the first two
months of the revolution brought about
by the military under the direction of the
Committee, no day passed without a
number of those <i>numâyashi</i>; masses of
people who jostled behind a couple of
flags with the legend “Liberty, Equality,
and Fraternity,” halted in front of some
public buildings or residences of persons
in authority and there applauded speeches
of which nobody could understand anything.
If one asked the shouters what
it was all about, one was told: “revolution,
liberty, hasn’t the police been
abolished?” and the like. In a similar
manner the Committeemen on November
14th treated the inhabitants to a <i>numâyashi</i>
lasting fully eight hours.</p>

<p>In the mosque of Mehmed the Conqueror,
which commemorates the greatest
victory of the Turks over Christianity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the conquest of Constantinople in 1452,
the questions and answers outlined above
were read aloud, the <i>fetwa</i>, that is, of
the holy war. Prayers were said, long
speeches were held, there was no end to
the jubilation. The procession passed
through the main parts of the city, waited
upon the Grand Vizier, and—demonstrated
in front of the German and the
Austrian embassies. Nazim-bey and
Mukhtar-bey, faithful Committeemen,
respectively complimented the German
and the Austrian ambassadors and their
speeches were answered by the ambassadors.
The addresses exchanged at the
German embassy would not have been
worded differently by Dr. Grothe himself.
For the German ambassador did
not only speak of Germany and Turkey,
but of their common struggle for the real
welfare of the Mohammedan world; of
Germany’s friendship for the Empire of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the Ottomans, but especially for the adherents
of Islâm, before <i>all</i> of whom, as
soon as the German and Turkish arms
have achieved victory, there lies a glorious
future. The Austrian ambassador was
a little more cautious and less Mohammedan
in his reply, and only mentioned
the holy war which the Empire of the Ottomans
is waging together with Austria,
and the sympathy which unites Austria
and Turkey. But the whole show must
have made on the Mohammedans, who
would not, as we do, think first of all of
a musical comedy of Offenbach, this
impression, if any: that Germany and
Austria have put themselves in the service
of Turkey for waging a <i>jihâd</i>; for naturally,
of the three, Turkey is the only one
that can be involved in a <i>jihâd</i>. To call
a war between <i>kâfirs</i> (unbelievers) a
<i>jihâd</i> is for a good Mohammedan either
blasphemous or ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Grothe has thus voiced the sentiments
of the ruling classes in his country, not
only where he discussed the economic
relations of Germany in most recent times
and in the future, but also where he
treated of the stirring up of the slumbering
Mohammedan fanaticism in the
interest of Germany. This makes it
somewhat less inexplicable to me that
my esteemed colleague, Professor C. H.
Becker at Bonn, who until recently honourably
represented the science of Islâm
in the Colonial Institute at Hamburg,
should also have been swept away by the
incredible <i>jihâd</i>-craze, which at present
seems to possess German statesmen. His
pamphlet <i>Germany and Islam</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> breathes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the same spirit as Grothe’s, although it is
favourably distinguished from the latter
by its more moderate tone and, it goes
without saying, by its knowledge of
Islâm.</p>

<p>Becker materially supplements Grothe’s
picture of the future relations between
Germany and Turkey, by including in
his program of protection of Turkey the
military and political renascence of the
Empire of the Crescent, in order that it
may be re-created into a modern constitutional
state with a respectable army.
Not only German products and German
capital, but also German spirit must set
to work in Turkey. It must do so according
to a better method than that
used by France and England in their
colonies: “a sound common-school education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
according to modern methods, but
on the basis of the traditional oriental
culture and supported by the best powers
of Islamic religion.” We shall revert
to this. First a few remarks in connexion
with the picture, which may be
seen in the writings of both Grothe and
Becker, of the growth of political harmony
between Germany and Turkey,
temporarily leaving aside that which
may be achieved through the Caliphate
and through Moslim fanaticism.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is easy to understand that Germany,
in view of the rapidly increased interests
which she has gained in Turkey, would
like to reduce to the smallest proportions
the dangers and difficulties that may be
caused by competitors. It is just as
easy to see that Turkey would after all
prefer to deal with Germany, as through
this contact loss of territory was not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
much to be feared. “After all,” so I
said intentionally; for there must have
been moments when the Sultan or the
Committee must have thought: Where
is that friendship? Under Abdulhamîd
the German affection was expressed only
to him who had all power vested in him,
but who is now generally considered to
have been the greatest enemy his people
ever knew. From 1888 to 1908 Germany
ignored the Turkish people, because it
could not be of use to Germany. Any
one knowing something of the nature of
European political friendship will not
wonder at this any more than at Emperor
William’s small interest in the fate of
the once-beloved Abdulhamîd, when the
latter was forced by the Committee first
to parade as a friend of liberty and later
to disappear.</p>

<p>Whoever sought favour or advantage
in Turkey after 1908, had to force it or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
beg it from the Committee. The latter
could not at once trust Germany, as also
our German writers remark, because the
liberal Turks, who had fled their country
before the revolution, were given the cold
shoulder in Germany on account of the
friendship with the despot. When Austria
availed herself of the general confusion
after the revolution, first to help in the
complete detachment of Bulgaria from
Turkey, afterwards to annex a piece of
Turkish territory herself, Germany did
not raise one finger to keep its ally from
an amputation so painful to Turkey.
Later on Italy took Tripoli and Turkey
found it difficult to fully appreciate the
fact that Germany was the only one in the
Triple Alliance who did not take anything,
because Turkey knew, as well as anybody
else, what natural obstacles there were to
such an undertaking. Where no such
natural obstacles existed, Germany took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
her part as greedily as the others; and
in Africa she even has subjected two million
Mohammedans to her authority, an
authority which will not be found by those
concerned to be less tyrannical than
the British-Indian and North-African
Mohammedans, according to Sultan
Mehmed Reshâd and according to
Becker, find the British or French administration.</p>

<p>Now Becker may argue: those Mohammedans
were already under our rule before
our great infatuation with Turkey
and Islâm began, and, besides, the coal-black
Moslems do not count for much
even in the eyes of Turks and Arabs.
But this is not a serious answer to the
objection, the more so since Islâm not
only repudiates the contempt for negroes
theoretically, but because practically all
ways have ever been much more widely
open to gifted negroes in Moslim than in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Christian countries. To be sure, Becker
has estimated the number of <i>oppressed</i>
Mohammedans who must now be helped
by Germany at only one hundred and
fifty million; so that only Russia, England,
and France are counted as oppressors.
But the Sultan in his manifesto
has mentioned the full three hundred
million, at which the Kaiser estimated
the adherents of Islâm, as victims to be
set free, and has thus by mistake included
amongst them the two million German
subjects and the Moslims under Austrian
and Italian rule, not to mention any
others.</p>

<p>During the Balkan War, the independence
of Turkey was certainly no less
seriously menaced than was now the
case before the <i>jihâd</i>-declaration; but
even then it received little support from
its German friend. Grothe remarks that
for the sake of Turkey alone it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
have been difficult to stir up in Germany
sufficient enthusiasm for a war, whereas
now, against the rivals, England and
Russia, it has been found so easy. Still,
it will have to be admitted that the effect
of Emperor William’s visits to the Sultan,
with which according to Becker and
Grothe, the conscious Islâm-policy of
Germany was inaugurated, has not developed
normally but that it has long
remained exceedingly latent.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>All this may emphasize the somewhat
one-sided character of Germany’s
policy still more than the writings of
Becker and Grothe, but it does not do
away with the fact that under the present
political constellation, Turkey herself may
derive great advantage from the alliance
with Germany. But, if now we imagine
the future as the German writers desire
it, the situation stripped of all accessories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
appears like this: Turkey freed by Germany
from all troublesome meddling of
England, France, and Russia, will fall
under German guardianship, and, though
with careful avoidance of the name, it
will become a <i>German protectorate</i>. Its
army, its administration, its finances,
everything will have to be thoroughly
reorganized by Germany. The relation
will be different in form only from the
protectorate of France in Morocco and
that of England in many a Mohammedan
principality. In calmer times eulogies
on the method by which the English in
India, the French in Northern Africa,
ruled their Mohammedans, have never
been lacking in Germany; although criticism
and indignation were never lacking
either, when German interests were at
stake. They talked of the <i>pax Britannica</i>
and of the <i>pax Gallica</i>, which had replaced
the former insecurity, confusion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
corruption. Even England’s work in
Egypt was appreciated, and favourable
opinions were heard about the Islâm-policy
of Russia in Central Asia. We
have no reason to expect less favourable
results of a German protectorate in Turkey;
nay it would even be possible that
they might avoid many mistakes of their
predecessors and that the end might
prove a blessing to Turkish countries.
But the Germans would certainly find
that the gratitude of the Turks would
end when the absolutely unavoidable
interference would start in earnest, even
if the Turks did not fail to recognize the
advantage to themselves of some of the
reforms determined upon.</p>

<p>Besides, the opinions of German experts
about Turkey and about Islâm, especially
about their possibilities for reorganization,
are not, at any rate were not
before this war, at all the same as those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
which are now so warmly defended
by Grothe and Becker. Professor Joh.
Marquart, at present Professor in the
University of Berlin, derides in the preface
of his work, <i>The Benin-collection of the
National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden</i>
(1913), “the alleged function of Islâm as
a bearer of culture,” and he speaks with
biting irony of the “blessings of the <i>jihâd</i>,
predatory murder on the path of Allah
turned into a religious duty,” <i>i. e.</i>, that
duty which Germany now has again
impressed on Turkey. It was not only
in German missionary circles that Islâm
was considered as the enemy who was
most of all to be fought, but in a German
colonial congress this resolution was
adopted: “<i>As the expansion of Islâm is
a serious danger to the development of our
colonies, the colonial congress suggests for
earnest consideration</i>,” etc.</p>

<p>Professor Martin Hartmann, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
teaches the science of Islâm at the Seminary
for Oriental Languages in Berlin,
and whose pen has given us a number of
notable writings on Islâm and on Turkey,
never tires of pointing out that the Moslims
are kept from participating in culture
mainly by the institutions of Islâm,
which scorns woman and despises non-believers.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>He calls the Caliphate of the Ottoman
Sultans a usurpation which could only
have been committed through contempt
for the holy tradition, a “<i>means of agitation</i>,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
an “<i>easy way to be considered by
the world of Islâm as a kind of fetish</i>”; he
says that “<i>this double quality</i> [of the Sultan-Caliph]
<i>has never been recognized by
the civilized powers</i>” and that the honest
abandonment of this title would rather
strengthen Turkey than weaken her. Of
course he also has a few things to say about
the holy war. About this he intentionally
put his opinion on record when the word
<i>jihâd</i> was brought up by the Turks in
their war with Italy over Tripoli, and he
made use of this expression which has
again become topical: “... <i>the threat of
holy war, i. e., of war against all unbelievers,
except against those who are expressly designated
to the community by the leaders of
Islâm as friends of Islâm. This idea is
madness.</i>” As the seat of the agitation
was at that time in Berlin, he adds to
this: “<i>Let this be a warning against the
creation of unrest by the excitation of religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
fanaticism. All civilized nations will
unanimously stand together against any such
attempt.</i>” I could quote reams of print with
similar contents; I content myself with one
more: “<i>Islâm is a religion of hate and of
war. It must not be suffered to be the ruling
principle in a nation of the civilized world.</i>”</p>

<p>I could quote at least as many utterances
of the same author which give the
impression that the Turks are the nation
least fitted in all the Turkish Empire to
do any good for the development of their
country. Everywhere, where the Turkish
element had obtruded itself on other
Mohammedans at the point of the sword,
it has “<i>destroyed cultural possessions and
has created nothing, absolutely nothing, in
the way of cultural values</i>.” Their religious
conceit is even more intolerable than
their national conceit. The Turks of
Constantinople are “<i>an awful pack</i>”
(“ein schauderhaftes Gesindel”) and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
“<i>honest Anatolian</i>” (who also appears in
Grothe) is a product of legend. And such
an inferior nation “<i>wants to be the ruling
element in the great empire from Scutari and
Prevesa to Van and Bassora</i>!”</p>

<p>Professor Hartmann has an exceedingly
lively temperament, and I would not
dream of endorsing all his opinions or
denying that his expressions are exaggerated.
But in knowledge of his subject
he stands far higher than Grothe; and
as regards Turkey, also higher than
Becker, together with whom he is the
chief representative of the science of
Islâm in Germany. Besides, Becker himself
has formerly expressed himself about
the Islâm question in much the same way,
although in a more moderate form and in
a different tone. Naturally, Becker himself
has been the first to feel the contrast
between his joining in the flourish with
the words Caliph and <i>jihâd</i> in his latest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
writings, and the opinions expressed by
him in former times of quiet scientific
work. He himself repeats the concluding
sentence of a lecture delivered by him
in Paris in 1910: “<i>If the solidarity of Islâm
is a phantom, the solidarity of the white
race is a reality</i>,” but now he does so in
order to weaken the impression of these
words and to limit them to the Islâm of
the negroes in Africa, who were the main
subject of his speech. Probably none of
the audience understood this limitation,
as the words quoted were immediately
preceded by these: “the fear that one
power might unite with Islâm to thwart
another, does not seem to me very well
founded.” Besides Becker had formerly,
<i>e. g.</i>, in 1904, in an article on Panislamism
represented the panislamistic idea as
contrary to the real interests of Turkey<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
“<i>The Young Turks had hoped</i> [after the
Russo-Turkish War of 1878] <i>to put an
end by their reforms just to that religious
element, which made of the Sultan above
everything else the Caliph, the protagonist
of Islâm, and thus</i> <b>made impossible the
normal development of the Ottoman
Empire, which after all is mainly made
up of Christians</b>.” And in the German
translation<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of the above-mentioned lecture,
which was delivered in Paris in
1910, the following additional passage
occurs: “<i>The Caliphate of the Sultan of
Constantinople was, up to the time of the
Young-Turkish revolution, the basis of
Turkey’s Islâm-policy. To be sure Young
Turkey has not abandoned the claim to
the Caliphate</i>; <b>but if she wishes at all to
grow into a constitutional state, she will
have to make as little use of it as possible....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
A strong Turkey, it goes without
saying, will never claim political sovereignty
over the Islamic subjects of other
powers....</b>”</p>

<p>In his latest pamphlet, <i>Deutschland und
der Islam</i>, Becker confesses his recent
conversion and argues that his long-cherished
notions were wrong. He, as
well as Grothe, dwells at length on the two
visits paid by Emperor William to Sultan
Abdulhamîd (1889 and 1898), the second
one combined with what Grothe calls
“<i>a political pilgrimage to the Holy Land</i>.”
The world has considered these visits,
the first of which took place one year after
the concession of the Anatolian railway,
that is to say in 1889, as overgorgeous
demonstrations of Germany’s industrial
and commercial interest in Turkey. The
way it was done made many, even in
Germany, shrug their shoulders. First
of all Abdulhamîd, the “blood-drinking”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
tyrant, in whose crimes the great powers
after all shared the guilt, on account of
what Berard, and together with him
Hartmann, called “<i>the conspiracy of silence</i>,”
seemed a strange object for such
a hearty expression of friendship, which
left behind it in Constantinople a lumbering
commemorative fountain, which
according to experts is an insult to good
taste. Furthermore, the impression produced
on the Moslim world was not at
all such as was intended. To be sure, it
was thought remarkable that the monarch
of a powerful European empire
should go twice to pay homage to the
Sultan, the more as it was known that
no return-visits of the Sultan followed;
<i>the caller</i> therefore showed himself to the
inhabitants as <i>the inferior</i>; and simple
Mohammedan souls, who draw their
knowledge of the world’s map and the
world’s history more from legends than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
from reality, saw in this a confirmation
of their belief that the whole earth is
subjected to the mightiest Moslim sovereign,
and that all princes are his vassals,
even if they are in parts very unruly.
Those homages in no way contributed to
the glory of Germany in the East, whatever
flatterers may palm off about it on
German travellers. The strangest impression
of all, however, was produced on
all those who know Islâm by the Emperor’s
speech on his second journey
(1898), at Damascus, at the grave of
Saladin, on which he also deposited a
wreath.</p>

<p>Saladin (Salâh-ad-din) has become
popular in Europe through the history
of the Crusades and especially through
Lessing; in the Mohammedan East his
name has been long forgotten, except by
the few students of history and literature.
These know him as an unscrupulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
politician, who by faithlessness and
treason had risen to great power, and
who is forgiven much because he was a
strictly orthodox <i>kâfir</i>-hater; and not as
the example of eighteenth-century tolerance
which Lessing in his <i>Nathan der
Weise</i> has made of him. On the grave of
this hater of Christianity, the Emperor
of a world-empire, which, as Becker reminds
us, has Christianity as its state-religion,
spoke these words: “<i>The three
hundred million Mohammedans that are
scattered through the world may rest assured
that the German Emperor will eternally</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
<i>be their friend.</i>”</p>

<p>This part of the display has made as
little permanent impression in the Moslim
world as Saladin himself; and German
scientists at that time shook their heads
when they heard of it. But now these
words suddenly are at a premium: Grothe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and Becker give their interpretations of
them, and the Turks have been so energetically
reminded of them that Nazim-bey
quoted them in his address to the
German ambassador and that the Sultan
by mistake borrowed from them the oftentimes
corrected, at any rate very antiquated,
census-figures of his manifesto.</p>

<p>Till recently Becker, “through ignorance,”
as he now avers, has “<i>considered
this emphasizing of the Caliph-title by
Germany as a mistake</i>”; but now, after
Prince von Bülow’s explanations in
<i>Deutschland unter Kaiser Wilhelm II.</i>, he
joyfully discovers in it the first powerful
expression of “<i>a conscious German Islâm-policy</i>”
and the proof “<i>that German policy
has from the first taken Islâm into account
as an international factor</i>.” Becker’s scientific
conscience, in this conversion and
in his defence of the adoption of the
Caliphate among the factors of international<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
politics, is not so untroubled as
that of Grothe, who does not seem to feel
at all the grotesqueness of this Islâm-policy.
At any rate, Becker says that
he does not wish to be considered as
having expressed an opinion on the relation
between Turkey and Germany; that
he restricts himself to stating the fact
that such a relation exists; that, as a
matter of fact, millions of dissatisfied
Mohammedan subjects of European
nations expect their salvation from Turkey,
and that the hour has struck for
Germany to make use of this mood.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Salvation from Turkey! The country
of which Martin Hartmann quite recently
said that “<i>the exclusion of the Islamic-Turkish
rule from Europe is drawing
near</i>”; and that “<i>she</i> [Turkey] <i>should
have been already long ago threatened with
being placed under guardianship</i>”; or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
again: “<i>thus will only come more quickly
that which will have to come sometime,
anyway: the lapsing of political power from
the hands of dying Turkdom</i>”; from Turkey,
which, according to Becker, must be
re-created and under the energetic direction
of Germany be transformed into a
modern civilized state, a thing which a
few years ago he declared to be feasible
only if the Caliphate-idea were either entirely
abandoned or emphasized as little
as possible!</p>

<p>How is it that Turkey suddenly is
considered able to do that which until
recently had been put aside as nonsense;
how is it that now they recommend
as useful to Turkey what, such a short
time ago, was considered a source of
certain ruin? When, in his <i>Ultimatum
des Panislamismus</i> Hartmann scourged
the agitators who wished to give to the
Turkish-Italian conflict the character of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
a religious war, he at the same time gave
the sharpest criticism imaginable of Germany’s
present attempt to revive the
dying mediæval fanaticism of the Mohammedan
world. “<i>Turkey can only exclaim:
Heaven protect me against my friends!</i>”—so
he then justly said. What may not
Turkey exclaim now that her best friend
is exciting her to religious war, and presently
turns over to her the Mohammedan
prisoners who fought against Germany,
in order to submit them to a politico-religious
conversion cure?</p>

<p>We can only attribute all this to the
lamentable upsetting of the balance, even
in the intellectual atmosphere, of what
we used to call the civilized world. For
in normal times we know that the Germans
are far too sensible and logical to
digest the enormous nonsense that a
thing which in general would be considered
as a shame for mankind and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
catastrophe for Turkey can become good
and commendable as soon as Germany
places herself behind or beside the Crescent.
We do not know what will be the
issue of many of the present terrible
happenings; but this, I think, I may
already now foretell with certainty, that
within a not very long time a number of
German writings will testify that also in
Germany indignation has been aroused
by the despicable game that is being
played with the Caliphate and the holy
war.</p>

<p>It would be risky, now that the facts
will so speedily speak their incontrovertible
language, to try to foretell in how
far the attempt to light the blaze of a
Mohammedan religious war on a large
scale, and thereby to cause endless confusion
in international relations, has a
chance to succeed. Hartmann formerly
denied the possibility with full conviction:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
“... <i>as soon</i>,” said he, “<i>as the representatives
of the various Islamic groups confer
together about common measures, the enormous
differences in ethnical, economic,
and intellectual tendencies among the two
hundred million Mohammedans show
themselves!</i>” Becker, who formerly called
“<i>the solidarity of Islâm a phantom</i>,” says
now: “<i>The great war which reveals and
decides so much, will also bring the proof
as to whether the often-discussed international
solidarity of Islâm is a real
factor or a delusion.</i>”</p>

<p>It is certain that if Germany persists
in her present “Islâm-policy” there will
be no lack of all sorts of measures destined
to put before the Mohammedan public
the history of the origins of that policy
and the new relation of vassal in which
the re-created Sultan-Caliph finds himself
with regard to Germany. But against
a Commander of the Faithful, himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
under an unbelieving Commander, even
Mohammedans of the old stamp, who
otherwise might have been duped by the
comedy, will have serious objections.
The main basis of the claim of the Ottoman
sultans was <i>their</i> sword; not a sword
that would be drawn and sheathed at the
order of an unbelieving “ally.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, we need not worry with regard
to our Dutch-Indian Mohammedan
population. They adopted Islâm when
the Turkish Empire had already come
into existence, but without Turkey’s noticing
it; and they have never had any
contact with the Crescent. The Sultan
of Rûm, as they call the Great Lord of
Constantinople, has remained a legendary
creature for them. To be sure, the panislamistic
idea has penetrated into the
East-Indian Archipelago, but it has found
little favourable ground. The large mass
of the lower classes remains untouched,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and the majority of the higher classes is
entirely immune against this politico-religious
mixture of deceit and nonsense.
And we have good reason to believe that
this immunity will constantly spread.
For if Germany has quite recently inaugurated
her “<i>conscious Islâm-policy</i>” with
the above-described displays, we have
already had for a few years longer our
conscious <i>educational policy</i> towards the
native population which history has entrusted
to our care; and against that,
Caliphate and holy war and other mediæval
iniquities are fortunately powerless.
If we only unshakably adhere to our
centuries-old guarantee of complete religious
liberty for our Mohammedans, and
at the same time continue to pursue our
educational policy at a constantly increased
pace, we shall never have to fear
the peculiar sort of “intellectual weapons”
which now for the first time are put into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
circulation with the trade-mark “made
in Germany.” Still, we keep hoping
in the interest of humanity that Germany
will before long withdraw the new product
from the market.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The holy war of Islâm is, as we have
remarked several times, a thoroughly
mediæval institution, which even the
Mohammedan world was outgrowing.
One of the peculiarities of this institution
we may sincerely admire: holy war against
co-members of the Mohammedan community
is absolutely excluded by the law
of Islâm. The restriction of the community
to Mohammedans, to those who
profess the same dogma about what is
beyond this life, is mediæval; but the
consideration of strife within the sphere
of the community as impious, provides
an excellent foundation for the highest social
civilization and is rather humiliating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
for the modern world. Let us hear what
Martin Hartmann in his excited tone
writes about it: “<i>In contrast to Islâm,
where war is on principle limited to war
against those of different belief as being
‘unbelievers,’ nobody in the Christian
world takes exception to war against adherents
of the same faith, and here the
servants of the church of Love are not infrequently
the most zealous in the urging, that
is, in denying the Gospel; they provide to
order the patriotic gesture, which in this
case represents a violation of the fifth commandment,
not to mention that other commandment:
Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself.</i>”</p>

<p>Indeed, in Islâm it is only necessary to
remove the mediæval restriction of the
right to complete political existence,
which was limited to members of the same
community, and to expand the idea of the
community to one embracing the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
world, in order to assure absolute world-peace,
an absolute command of the divine
law. To modern states which have
Mohammedans as subjects, protégés, or
allies, the beautiful task is reserved of
educating these and themselves at the
same time to this high conception of
human society; rather than leading them
back, for their own selfish interests, into
the ways of mediæval religious hatred
which they were just about to leave.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
